# React Project
Completed by Hyo Kim

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Using the Figma link provided, a mock up has been created.

A couple enhancements were made:
1. using react-query to manager server state
2. some animations (hovering on card, loading icon when data is being fetched, etc)
